# Contributing to Frakto Code Engine

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project — your input helps make it better for everyone!

**Frakto Code Engine** is a VS Code extension that acts as a universal bridge between VS Code and external formatting/linting tools. It's designed to be completely unopinionated - the extension provides the infrastructure to pipe content to external scripts and handle their responses, but doesn't include any built-in formatters or linters.

## Philosophy

Every contribution should aim to preserve the clarity, predictability, and maintainability of the transformation pipeline. Code must be written with long-term extensibility in mind, following consistent patterns and strict syntax rules.
